# Multi-omic COVID-19 analysis

This repository is to replicate analyses from the manuscript titled "Integrated plasma proteomic and single-cell immune signaling network signatures demarcate mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19".

R software is needed to run the code.

Data are available from the lead author upon reasonable request.

The R pipeline “20201204 Multiomic Factor analysis.Rmd” contains code to reproduce the figures and analyses below, as well as several ancillary analyses to evaluate the quality of the multi-omic factor model. See also "20201204 Multiomic Factor analysis.html" for the report rendered from the .rmd file.\

Figure 1E: Top factors discriminating Mild, Moderate, and Severe COVID-19\
Figure S3: Multi-omic factor analysis (MOFA) identifies shared sources of variability across single-cell cytometry and proteomic data that are associated with COVID-19 severity\
Figure S5: Correlation analysis of patient characteristics with severity

See also the R pipeline "20201204 COVID19 GAM factor smooth interaction.Rmd" for the longitudinal analysis of cytof and proteomics variables using general additive models with factor-smooth interactions.
